# Interview Prep Lab (React + Vite)

A hands-on playground app to practice and explain common **JavaScript + React interview topics** via small interactive “labs”.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Labs (current scaffold)

- **Home**: quick sanity check (writes to the in-app Console)
- **JS Core**: placeholder (var/let/const, hoisting, closures, `this`, call/apply/bind, Map)
- **Async & Event Loop**: starter demo (sync vs microtasks vs macrotasks)
- **React Hooks**: starter demo (useMemo/useCallback)
- **State (Context/Redux)**: placeholder
- **Performance**: starter demo (slow component toggle for profiling later)

## Notes

- The original repo README snapshot was preserved as `README.root.md`.
